1.
(a)
True

(b)
True

(c)
False
Since each replica treats other's operations in different orders, the reads in 
different replicas may read different values, hence causing different states in 
different replicas.


For (d) and (e), assume to reserve seats, clients need to first read then write.

(d)
False
Since each client see other's operations in different orders, client 1
can see the write of client 2 before its own read, but client can see the write
of client2 after its own read, so it will overbook.
For example:
---------------------------------------------
C1: r(x)0   w(x)1
---------------------------------------------
C2:   r(x)0  w(x)2
---------------------------------------------
C3:     r(x)2  r(x)1
---------------------------------------------
C4:     r(x)1  r(x)2
---------------------------------------------
It's causal consistent but will overbook.

(e)
False 
Some global orderings can cause overbooking. 
For example:
---------------------------------------------
C1: r(x)0   w(x)1
---------------------------------------------
C2:   r(x)0  w(x)2
---------------------------------------------
C3:     r(x)2
---------------------------------------------
The global ordering is  r(x)0 r(x)0 w(x)1 w(x)2 r(x)2 and it's sequential 
consistent but will overbook.
